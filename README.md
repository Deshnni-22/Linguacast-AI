# LinguacastAI 🎧🌍

Personalized AI-Powered Language Learning Podcast Generator

🌟 Overview
LinguacastAI is a full-stack web application that generates customized 5-minute language learning podcasts based on user-provided English prompts. Designed for language learners, the app combines AI-powered translation, native-like text-to-speech (TTS), and interactive pronunciation feedback to deliver an immersive and personalized learning experience.

🎯 Key Features
Prompt-Based Learning: Users input an English sentence, which the system translates and transforms into a mini podcast in the target language.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts translated text into natural-sounding speech to enhance listening and pronunciation skills.

Speech Recognition: Provides pronunciation feedback by comparing user speech to the correct form.

Multilingual Support: Supports multiple languages like French, Spanish, and more (customizable).

Interactive Experience: Reinforces learning through repetition and interactive practice.

Clean UI/UX: Built with a responsive and intuitive design for seamless use across devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python (Flask)

AI/NLP: OpenAI API (for translation & sentence generation)

Speech Processing: Web Speech API (TTS & Speech Recognition)

Database & Hosting: Firebase (for user data and media storage)

🚀 How It Works
User enters an English sentence as a prompt.

The system translates the sentence and enriches it into a short lesson.
